title: "About me"
---

I'm **Pascual Montesinos**, *Staff Engineer at Mercadona Tech*, with **over two decades of experience in software development**.  
Throughout my career, I've taken on different roles — **programmer**, **analyst**, **tech lead**, and **product engineer** — which have given me a broad perspective on engineering and strengthened my belief that good software is built through **clarity**, **collaboration**, and **continuous learning**.

---

## 🎯 Mission
Help engineering teams **design sustainable backend systems**, **improve their technical decision-making**, and **foster a culture of quality and collaboration**, where code becomes a medium for shared understanding and continuous value delivery.

---

## 🌍 Vision
Contribute to a development environment where **Extreme Programming (XP)** practices, **evolutionary design**, and **technical empathy** are part of the everyday culture—enabling organizations that learn and evolve continuously.

## 💡 Values

**Simplicity**  
Clarity is a form of sustainability. I strive for solutions that are easy to understand and evolve, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Collaboration**  
Code is a shared effort. I enjoy creating environments where teams think together, learn collectively, and make decisions with autonomy.

**Pragmatism**  
Every technical choice should have a purpose. I value practical, maintainable solutions over theoretical elegance.

**Continuous learning**  
Software development is a constant learning process. I value curiosity, incremental improvement, and honest feedback.

**Long-term sustainability**  
I aim to build systems and teams that can evolve without friction. Technical and organizational sustainability are the best measures of good design.
